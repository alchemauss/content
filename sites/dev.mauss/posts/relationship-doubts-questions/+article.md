1. Are you truly fulfilled or just less lonely?
2. Are you able to be unapologetically yourself or do you feel the need to show up differently to please them?
3. Are you in love with your partner right now or only with the potential of who they could be in the future?
4. If someone told you that you're a lot like your partner, would this be a compliment?
5. Would you want your future or imagine child to date someone like your partner?

...

Some of these questions can also be asked in a non-romantic context with your best friend, or even to improve your relationship with yourself. Relationships aren't always easy, but they should be worth it, and it's important to communicate with your partner and work through your doubts together. Remember that it's okay to have doubts, as long as you address them and work towards a healthy and fulfilling relationship.
