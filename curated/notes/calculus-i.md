## Limits

## Derivatives

### Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithm Functions

Derivative of a natural logarithm $\ln u$ will be the $u'$ over $u$ itself.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{d}{dx} & \ln u = \frac{u'}{u} \\[0.5em]
  \\\frac{d}{dx} & \ln x = \frac{1}{x} \\[0.5em]
  \frac{d}{dx} & \ln x^2+7 = \frac{2x}{x^2+7}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Implicit Differentiation

The derivatives we've seen are mostly functions of the form $y=f(x)$. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and not all the functions that we're going to look will fall into this form.

### Tangent Line at a Point

$$x^3+4xy^2+y^3=107 \quad P(2,3)$$

Get the slope ($m$) of the tangent line first by finding the first derivative of the function, which is $\frac{dy}{dx}(2,3)$. Then, use the point-slope form $[y-y_1=m(x-x_1)]$ to write the equation of the tangent line.

## Integration

### Trigonometric Substitution

$$
\int \sqrt{a^2-x^2} dx \iff x \sin\theta \\[1em]
\int \sqrt{a^2+x^2} dx \iff x \tan\theta \\[1em]
\int \sqrt{x^2-a^2} dx \iff x \sec\theta
$$
